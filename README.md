üìÇ Project Structure
The project is organized in a monorepo structure with two main directories:

/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-manager-backend/   # Contains the Node.js, Express, and Prisma API
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task-manager-frontend/  # Contains the React and Tailwind CSS client
üèÅ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)

PostgreSQL

Git

Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/task-manager-app.git
cd task-manager-app
Setup the Backend

Bash

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd task-manager-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file from the example
# (You can manually rename .env.example or use this command)
cp .env.example .env 
Now, open the .env file and add your PostgreSQL database URL and a JWT secret key.

Code snippet

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/taskmanager?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY"
Finally, apply the database schema:

Bash

npx prisma migrate dev
Setup the Frontend

Bash

# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd ../task-manager-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
Running the Application
You'll need two separate terminals to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

Run the Backend Server (in the task-manager-backend directory)

Bash

npm run dev
The API will be running on http://localhost:5000.

Run the Frontend Server (in the task-manager-frontend directory)

Bash

npm run dev
The React app will open in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

You can now register a new user and start managing your tasks!
